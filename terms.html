                <h2>Termination</h2>
                <p>
                    You may stop using the App at any time. To cancel your subscription, you must do so 
                    through your App Store account settings at least 24 hours before your next renewal date. 
                    Simply deleting the App does not cancel your subscription. We reserve the right to 
                    terminate or suspend access to the App for users who violate these Terms.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of any material 
                    changes by posting the new Terms on this page and updating the "Last updated" date. 
                    Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.

                <h2>Severability</h2>
                <p>
                    If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions 
                    will continue to be valid and enforceable.
