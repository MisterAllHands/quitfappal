	                <h2>Introduction</h2>
	                <p>
	                    Welcome to QuitPal. We are committed to protecting your privacy 
	                    and ensuring you have a positive experience using our app. This Privacy Policy explains how 
	                    we handle information when you use the QuitPal mobile application and when you interact with our website at quitfappal.com.
	                </p>
	                <p>
	                    <strong>The short version:</strong> Your recovery data is stored on your device by default. If you sign in, the app can sync a snapshot to our cloud backend to support backup and cross-device sync (for signed-in users, sync may be enabled by default, and you can disable it anytime). We use Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics to improve reliability, and if you use the AI Coach we send your messages and selected context to Google Gemini. If you submit forms on our website, your submission is processed by Web3Forms.
	                </p>

                <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
                
                <h3 style="font-size: 1.2rem; margin-top: 24px; color: var(--gray-700);">Authentication Data</h3>
                <p>
                    QuitPal uses Google Sign-In and Apple Sign-In for authentication. When you sign in, we receive:
                </p>

                <p>
                    We use this information solely to identify your account and enable data sync. We do not share 
                    this information with third parties for marketing purposes.
                </p>

                <h3 style="font-size: 1.2rem; margin-top: 24px; color: var(--gray-700);">Subscription Data</h3>
                <p>
                    We use RevenueCat to manage subscriptions and in-app purchases. When you subscribe, RevenueCat collects:
                </p>

	                    <li>Subscription status and renewal information</li>
	                    <li>An identifier linked to your account (for example, your app user ID)</li>
	                </ul>
                <p>
                    This data is necessary to provide you with premium features and manage your subscription. 
                    For more information, see <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" style="color: var(--primary);">RevenueCat's Privacy Policy</a>.
                </p>

                <h2>Information We DON'T Collect</h2>
                <p>QuitPal is designed with privacy as a core principle. We do NOT collect:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your location or GPS data</li>
                    <li>Your contacts or phone data</li>
                    <li>Your browsing history</li>
                    <li>Device advertising identifiers (IDFA)</li>
                    <li>Any health data from HealthKit</li>
                </ul>

	                <h2>Your Recovery Data</h2>
	                <p>
	                    Your recovery data is stored on your device and may include:
	                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your streak count and history</li>
                    <li>Daily check-in records (mood, notes, coping strategies)</li>
                    <li>Journal entries</li>
                    <li>Urge logs and coping tool usage</li>
                    <li>Milestone achievements</li>
                    <li>Onboarding responses (motivations, triggers, personal vision)</li>
                    <li>AI-generated insights and weekly summaries</li>
                    <li>Conversation history with the AI Coach</li>

                </ul>
	                <p>
	                    This data is stored on your device. If you sign in, cloud sync may be enabled by default and the app can upload a snapshot of this data to Firebase Firestore (and may use Apple iCloud/CloudKit as a fallback) to support backup and cross-device sync. You can disable cloud sync in Settings and you can export or delete your data at any time.
	                </p>

                <h2>AI Coach Feature</h2>
                <p>
                    When you use the AI Coach feature, information is sent to our AI service provider (Google Gemini) 
                    to generate personalized responses. This includes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your messages to the coach</li>
                    <li>Your current recovery statistics (streak length, clean days, goal progress)</li>
                    <li>Today's activity summary (check-ins completed, urges logged, tools used)</li>

                    <li>Self-reported triggers and high-risk times</li>
                    <li>Detected behavioral patterns from your journey data</li>
                    <li>Insights extracted from your journal entries</li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Important notes about AI data:</strong>

	                <p>
	                    We use Firebase Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics to understand how the app is used and to fix bugs, crashes, and performance issues. This may include:

	                    <li>Usage events (for example: feature usage, check-in completion, tool usage). Some events may include self-reported signals you enter, such as mood ratings or selected trigger categories.</li>
	                </ul>
	                <p>
	                    This data may be associated with your app instance and, if you sign in, with your Firebase user ID. We do not use this information for advertising or cross-app tracking, and we do not use the iOS advertising identifier (IDFA).
